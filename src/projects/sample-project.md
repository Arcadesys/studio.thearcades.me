This is a sample project to demonstrate how to structure project entries in your portfolio. Replace this content with actual information about your project.

## How It Was Made

I built this project using Eleventy as the static site generator, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The design was created with a focus on user experience and accessibility.

### Key Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark mode support
- Fast loading times
- SEO optimized

### Development Process

The development process involved several stages:

1. **Planning**: I started by defining the project requirements and creating wireframes.
2. **Design**: Next, I created the visual design in Figma, focusing on a clean and modern aesthetic.
3. **Development**: I implemented the design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Eleventy for static site generation.
4. **Testing**: I thoroughly tested the site on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
5. **Deployment**: Finally, I deployed the site to Netlify for hosting.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing the dark mode toggle without causing a flash of unstyled content. I solved this by using a combination of CSS variables and JavaScript to detect the user's preference and apply the appropriate theme.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience that helped me improve my skills in frontend development and static site generation. I'm particularly proud of the performance optimizations and the clean, accessible design.
