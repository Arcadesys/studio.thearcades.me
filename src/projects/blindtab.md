BlindTab is a productivity-focused new tab replacement that helps you stay on task without distractions. It provides a clean, minimalist interface that keeps you focused on what matters.

## How It Was Made

I built BlindTab using Next.js and React for the frontend, with Neon for the backend data storage. The initial boilerplate was scaffolded with assistance from Cursor and Claude 3.7, which helped accelerate the development process.

### Key Features

- Distraction-free new tab experience
- Customizable productivity tools
- Dark/light mode support
- Quick access to essential information
- Minimalist design philosophy

### Development Process

The development process followed these steps:

1. **Concept**: I started with the idea of creating a distraction-free new tab experience that would help users stay focused.
2. **Prototyping**: Using Next.js and React, I built a quick prototype to test the core functionality.
3. **Database Design**: I implemented Neon for efficient and reliable data storage.
4. **UI Development**: The interface was designed with Tailwind CSS to create a clean, responsive experience.
5. **Testing & Refinement**: I iteratively tested and improved the application based on usage patterns.

### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was balancing simplicity with functionality. I wanted to create something minimal but still useful enough to replace a standard new tab. The solution was to implement a modular design that allows users to customize which productivity tools they want to display.

## Conclusion

BlindTab demonstrates how thoughtful design constraints can create more useful tools. By intentionally limiting visual noise and emphasizing focus, the app helps users stay productive in an increasingly distracting digital environment.
