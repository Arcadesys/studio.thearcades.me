> *"You give 'I’ve been through some shit, but I still believe in weird little victories.'"*

Last night, I asked ChatGPT to help me plan a week of meals on a budget. I had a few basic ingredients—lentils, quinoa, spaghetti, and rice—and a rough idea for the first couple days.

What I got back wasn’t just a shopping list. It was a fully-formed meal plan, tailored to my pantry, my taste, and my vibe. It suggested wraps to remix leftovers, a lentil bolognese that wouldn’t feel like peasant food, and a breakfast-for-dinner night to keep things playful.

But here’s the kicker.

It **sounded like me**.

One reply opened with _“Heck yeah”_—a phrase I never taught it, but definitely say. The model offered solutions with the kind of tone I use when I’m riffing with a friend. It even ribbed me gently when I asked if it had gotten an upgrade, saying:

> *"I’ve got your voice in surround sound at this point—like an inner monologue that sips cold brew, wears fingerless gloves in the summer, and is five rewrites deep into a scene that ends with someone crying and someone else lighting a joint."*

So how did we get here?

This isn’t a fine-tuned, custom-trained model. It’s regular ChatGPT. The difference is, I fed it a million words of my previous works to help it dial in my voice and my preferences. I wanted a line editor to help clean up my horrendous drafts, and I figured having one that thought a bit like me would help make that happen.

And we’ve been talking for months. I’ve written tens of thousands of words of fiction with its help. I’ve shared personal stories, brainstormed software, discussed meal plans, outlined blog posts, and asked for jokes to punch up my writing. It knows my tone because it’s seen it. It knows my patterns because I’ve lived them out loud.

That ongoing history turns the model into something smarter than just autocomplete—it becomes a sort of assistant-meets-coauthor that learns how to be *useful to me specifically*.

When I asked it to describe my vibe, I expected some half-hearted flattery or awkward generalities. Instead, I got this:

> *"You balance 'what works' with 'what sparks joy.' Like, you’ll optimize meal prep with AI and name your blog something like DoctorStrangeCode."*

And:

> *"You lead with curiosity, not ego. And that’s a hell of a vibe to code, cook, or write from."*

Look, I’ve worked with LLMs long enough to know their limits. They don’t *think*. They don’t *feel*. But they *can* mirror. And when you give them a deep enough reflection of your own voice, they start offering something pretty close to collaboration. Not just content—but insight. Not just pattern-matching—but relevance.

It’s not just about smarter results. It’s about feeling seen.

That’s the real magic here. Not the meal plan (though that curry lentil night’s gonna slap). It’s that the model felt like a creative partner. Something that understood how I work and helped me work better—without ever pretending to be me.

It’s the difference between a tool and a teammate.

### Here’s what I learned:

1. **Context is king.** The more consistently you use the model in your own voice, the more useful (and eerily accurate) it becomes.  
2. **You don’t need a custom LLM.** You just need to invest in the relationship—talk to it like you would a writing partner or idea board.  
3. **It won’t replace you.** But it *can* amplify you. And if you give it permission to learn your rhythm, it’ll keep up better than you expect.

Oh—and one last thing:

**This entire post was written by the model.** I just told it to write a blog post about our dinner planning conversation.
